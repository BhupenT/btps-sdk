# BTPS: Billing Trust Protocol Secure

**BTPS** is an open, trust-based protocol for secure, cryptographically verifiable billing and invoice communication. Inspired by DKIM and modern email protocols, BTPS is designed for SaaS, fintech, and enterprise platforms that require robust, consent-based, and auditable billing workflows.

## üöÄ Vision

Enable a global, interoperable, and secure network for billing and invoice exchange‚Äîwhere only trusted parties can send and receive sensitive financial documents, and every message is cryptographically verifiable.

---

## What is BTPS?

- **A protocol** for secure, trust-based billing/invoice communication (like email, but for billing).
- **A trust model**: Only trusted senders can deliver bills/invoices to your platform.
- **Cryptographic security**: All messages are signed, encrypted, and verifiable.
- **Key rotation and onboarding**: Built-in support for safe key rotation and trust management.
- **Open source SDKs**: Easily build BTPS servers, clients, and integrations.

## Why BTPS?

- **Stop invoice fraud**: Only trusted, cryptographically verified senders can deliver bills.
- **Automate onboarding**: DNS-based trust and key management, with proof-based rotation.
- **Interoperable**: Works across SaaS, banks, fintech, and enterprise platforms.
- **Auditable**: Every message and trust change is verifiable and logged.
- **Open**: Free to use, extend, and integrate.
