# BTPS: Billing Trust Protocol Secure

**BTPS** is an open, trust-based protocol for secure, cryptographically verifiable billing and invoice communication. It is designed to stop invoice fraud, automate onboarding, and enable secure, auditable, and interoperable billing workflows across SaaS, fintech, and enterprise platforms.

## üåç What is BTPS?

BTPS (Billing Trust Protocol Secure) is a next-generation protocol for exchanging billing and financial documents securely between organizations. It combines the best of email-like addressing, DNS-based identity, and modern cryptography to ensure that only trusted, verified parties can send and receive sensitive billing information.

- **Email-like addressing:** Use familiar addresses like `billing$vendorcorp.com` to send and receive documents.
- **Trust-based delivery:** Only approved senders can deliver bills/invoices to your platform‚Äîno more spam or fraud.
- **Cryptographic security:** Every message is signed, encrypted, and verifiable end-to-end.
- **Automated onboarding:** DNS and `.well-known` records make trust establishment and key rotation seamless.
- **Open and extensible:** Integrate with any backend, database, or workflow using the open SDK.

## üí° Why BTPS? (The Problem & Solution)

- **Invoice fraud is rampant:** Billions are lost to fake invoices and business email compromise every year. BTPS ensures only trusted, cryptographically verified senders can deliver bills.
- **Manual onboarding is slow:** BTPS automates trust establishment and key management using DNS and protocol handshakes, reducing friction and errors.
- **Lack of interoperability:** BTPS is open and federated‚Äîany SaaS, bank, or enterprise can join and interoperate securely.
- **Audit and compliance:** Every message and trust change is logged and verifiable, supporting compliance and audit needs.
- **Flexible for all sizes:** From startups to global enterprises, BTPS scales from file-based trust stores to full database and cloud integrations.

## üîí How Does BTPS Work?

1. **Identity & Discovery:**
   - Every participant publishes a DNS TXT record and optional `.well-known` trust file, advertising their public key and inbox endpoint.
   - Addresses look like `username$domain.com` (e.g., `billing$vendorcorp.com`).
2. **Trust Establishment:**
   - Senders must request trust from receivers before sending business documents.
   - Receivers approve, reject, or block senders. Only trusted senders can deliver documents.
3. **Secure Message Exchange:**
   - All messages are signed and encrypted using strong cryptography (RSA, Ed25519, AES-256, etc.).
   - Servers verify sender identity, trust status, and document integrity before accepting any message.
4. **Key Rotation & Revocation:**
   - Key changes are managed via DNS and `.well-known` records. Trust can be revoked or expired at any time.
5. **Extensible & Auditable:**
   - Plug in custom trust stores (file, SQL, NoSQL, cloud), middleware, and integrations (webhooks, metrics, etc.).
   - All trust and message operations are logged for audit and compliance.

## üö® Problems with Current Billing Systems

### User Problems with Sending and Receiving Bills

- **Security Concerns:** Users worry about the security of sensitive financial information when bills are transmitted online.
- **Lack of Integration:** Billing systems often don't integrate well with accounting software, CRM systems, or other business tools.
- **Inconsistencies and Errors:** Manual processes lead to errors in bills, such as wrong amounts, duplicate bills, or missing invoices.
- **Payment Inconvenience:** Different vendors require different payment methods, leading to confusion and inconvenience.
- **Poor Tracking and Notifications:** Inadequate notifications about bill due dates lead to late payments and penalties.
- **Accessibility Issues:** Many users struggle to access or navigate online billing platforms, especially those with disabilities or limited tech skills.
- **Environmental Concerns:** Users want eco-friendly digital solutions but find current alternatives complex or unreliable.

### How BTPS Solves These Problems

- **Enhanced Security:** BTPS provides end-to-end encryption, cryptographic verification, and trust-based delivery to protect sensitive billing data.
- **Seamless Integrations:** BTPS's open protocol and SDK enable easy integration with any accounting, CRM, or business software.
- **Automated Error Prevention:** Built-in validation, trust verification, and cryptographic signing prevent errors and ensure data integrity.
- **Unified Trust Network:** BTPS creates a federated network where any trusted sender can deliver to any trusted receiver, regardless of platform.
- **Smart Notifications:** BTPS servers can integrate with notification systems to provide reliable, secure delivery confirmations.
- **Accessible by Design:** BTPS's email-like addressing and standard protocols make it familiar and accessible to all users.
- **Digital-First:** BTPS eliminates paper waste while providing secure, verifiable digital alternatives.

## üè¢ Why SaaS Billing Systems Should Implement BTPS

### Smart Transactions and Immutable Records

Every bill, invoice, payslip, invitation, acceptance, and payment becomes a **smart transaction contract**‚Äîserving as the definitive, immutable, and irrefutable record at each point in time. Users enjoy complete transparency with comprehensive, cryptographically verified transaction histories.

### Developer-Friendly Marketplace and Community

BTPS enables a thriving ecosystem of tools, extensions, and modules:

- **Layouts and Templates:** Pre-built, customizable billing document templates
- **Accounting Platform Integrations:** Seamless connections with QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, and more
- **Developer Tools:** Intuitive APIs and SDKs for custom integrations
- **Monetization:** Developers can charge for extensions via subscription or one-time payments (similar to an "App Store" model)
- **Innovation Hub:** Open protocol fosters collaboration and rapid innovation

### Competitive Advantages for SaaS Platforms

- **Trust and Security:** Distinguish your platform with enterprise-grade security and trust verification
- **Interoperability:** Connect with any other BTPS-compliant system without custom integrations
- **Compliance:** Built-in audit trails and cryptographic verification support regulatory requirements
- **Scalability:** Handle millions of transactions with automated trust management
- **User Experience:** Provide seamless, secure billing experiences that users trust
